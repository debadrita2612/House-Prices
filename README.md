# House-Prices

To predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms and square footage, we can build a simple linear regression model using Python and Scikit-learn. Here’s a step-by-step description of how to approach this:

Dataset Preparation:

Obtain a dataset that includes features such as number of bedrooms, square footage (or area), and corresponding house prices. Ensure the dataset is clean and structured, typically in a CSV or similar format.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data if necessary (handle missing values, outliers).
Extract the features (number of bedrooms, square footage) and the target variable (house prices).
Splitting Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows us to train the model on one set of data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
Building the Linear Regression Model:

Import the necessary libraries from Scikit-learn (LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model).
Create an instance of the linear regression model.
Fit the model to the training data. This involves training the model to learn the relationship between the features (number of bedrooms, square footage) and the target variable (house prices).
Model Evaluation:

Use the testing set to make predictions using the trained model.
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared score, or others depending on the context.
Prediction:

Once evaluated, the model can be used to predict house prices for new data based on the number of bedrooms and square footage provided.
